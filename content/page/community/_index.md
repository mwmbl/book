# Mwmbl is a Community First

The community is the most important part of Mwmbl, since everything we
do depends on you. We aim to be one of the most friendly, diverse and
welcoming communities on the internet.

The main place we hang out is on [our Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#mwmbl:matrix.org)
but we also have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/SJF689E3Rv),
and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mwmbl), along with a
bunch of unmaintained socials...

If you like Mwmbl, please get in touch and tell us! Knowing that
people care about Mwmbl is the biggest motivation to keep going :)

# Running the Mwmbl Crawler with Docker Compose

You can easily run the Mwmbl crawler on your own server using Docker Compose. This setup includes both the crawler and a Redis instance for task coordination and state management.

## New crawler vs old crawler

The new crawler lives in the [Mwmbl repo](https://github.com/mwmbl/mwmbl/).
This crawler is considerably more resource intensive compared to the
old crawler, which was a relatively simple Python script. The problem
with the [old crawler](https://github.com/mwmbl/crawler-script/) was
that in order to run it, we needed to use a
lot of resources on the central server, which was slowing down the
main site. This was not good.

So if you're able to run the new crawler, please do. Eventually, we
will ask people who are still running the old crawler to stop so that
we can free up resources on the central server.

## API Key

In order to run the crawler you need an API key.
If you would like to run the crawler, please get in touch either on
[our Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#mwmbl:matrix.org) or by
sending an email to [info@mwmbl.org](mailto:info@mwmbl.org).

Please give a few words about yourself and why you are interested in
crawling for Mwmbl.

Once we've approved your application, we'll send you an API key.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- A Mwmbl API key (you can [request one here](#))

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwmbl/mwmbl.git
   cd mwmbl
   ```

2. **Set your API key**

   You can either export your API key in your shell:

   ```bash
   export MWMBL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

   Or create a `.env` file in the root of the repository:

   ```env
   MWMBL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

3. **Start the crawler**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the crawler using `Dockerfile.crawler`
   - Start the crawler and a Redis instance
   - Persist crawler data in a volume (`~/.mwmbl` inside the container)
   - Persist Redis data in a separate volume

---

## Configuration Options

You can configure the crawler via environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file or `.env` file:

- `MWMBL_API_KEY` – **Required**: Your API key.
- `CRAWLER_WORKERS` – Number of parallel processes to run (default: 2).
- `REDIS_URL` – Redis connection string (default: `redis://redis:6379`).

---

## Data Persistence

Both services store data in named Docker volumes:

- **Crawler data**: Persisted in a volume mapped to `~/.mwmbl` inside the container.
- **Redis data**: Persisted in a volume mapped to `/data` inside the Redis container.

These volumes ensure that data is **retained between restarts and upgrades**.

---

## Managing the Crawler

Stop the services without removing data:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

Stop and **remove all data** (crawler + Redis):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

View logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

Access the crawler container:

```bash
docker exec -it mwmbl-crawler bash
```
