# Mwmbl Roadmap

Our roadmap is divided into product, organization and community. For each of these, we have medium term goals - 
within the next five years, and long term goals.

## Product

### Medium term goals

Search:
- Develop the search engine to a point where results are satisfactory, measured as an 80% NDCG score on the Bing dataset
- Maintain current response speed, i.e. less than 100ms
- Build a server-side crawler to crawl specific sites and enhance our results

Curation:
- Allow users to log into Mwmbl
- Offer paid plans along with a free one
- Build a reward system similar to Stack Overflow to recognize contributions of users
- Allow users to suggest a site to crawl
- Allow users to suggest a new result for a query
- Allow them to reorder and remove results for a query

Webmaster tools:
- Allow users with a webmaster plan to crawl site(s) of their choice
- Provide feedback on number of pages crawled, and page-query rankings
- Provide feedback on page quality and suggestions for improvements

### Long term goals

Search:
- Build a dataset of curated search results from our own users that is bigger than our current Bing dataset
