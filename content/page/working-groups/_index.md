# Working groups

If you want to help out with Mwmbl, this is the place to be! Working
groups allow people to coordinate work on a specific aspect of
Mwmbl. Get in touch on our [Matrix Space](https://matrix.to/#/#mwmbl:matrix.org)
and let us know how you'd like to be involved.


# Community and Communication

This group is responsible for liasing with the Mwmbl community, and
promoting Mwmbl via blogging, social media and traditional media. So
far we have a [blog](https://blog.mwmbl.org), a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mwmbl)
and a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/mwmblorg),
and we have a very long way to go in terms of filling them out!

We need creators of all types including writers, designers and video creators who
care about the things we're working on.

# Incorporation

We need to form an official organisation to allow us to do things like
open bank accounts and accept donations with tax benefits. This group
is responsible for logistics of doing this.

We need someone with general managerial skills, any experience with
law, contracts, accounts or bookkeeping would be fantastic.

# Webmaster Tools

At the moment the Mwmbl software is focused on search users. But we
need to build software to be used by webmasters too. This helps with
our long term goal of _making the web a better place_, since the
webmaster tools will show how sites can be designed to improve the
user experience.

We need people with all kinds of skills including product specialists,
designers, UX experts, and front and back-end developers.

# Mwmbl Platform

This group is going to implement the most exciting aspect of Mwmbl
that doesn't exist yet: allowing users to edit the search results. We
will become the Wikipedia of search!

It is also responsible for maintaining the entire front-end.

We need product specialists, designers, UX experts, and front and
back-end developers.

# Infrastructure

This team is responsible for implementing continuous deployment and
making sure the site runs reliably.

We need infrastructure engineers and software developers.

# Search Quality

This team is responsible for continuously improving the search results
quality. This includes building datasets and evaluation frameworks,
and designing new ranking algorithms to improve our results.

We need product specialists, NLP specialists, search engineers, data
scientists and machine learning engineers.

# Search Engineering

This team is responsible for developing the core search engine
functionality. This needs to be maintained independently from the
Mwmbl platform as it can potentially become a popular resource in its
own right. It involves optimising the code to make it as fast and
resource efficient as possible.

We need product specialists, search engineers and software engineers.

# Fraud and Spam Prevention

As we continue to grow, fraud and spam will become serious
problems. Fraud prevention will need to be built into the platform.

We need product specialists, data scientists, machine learning
engineers and software engineers.

<!-- # Web Standards and Interoperability -->

<!-- TBD -->

# Localization

This team is responsible for allowing Mwmbl to work in as many locales
as possible.

We need product specialists, translators and software engineers.

# Semantic Web and Structured Data

Where standards for structured data are already being used, we need to
make use of them within Mwmbl, and we also need to encourage the
adoption of new and existing standards for structured data. This team
is responsible for making that happen!

We need product specialists, semantic web and structured data experts
and software engineers.

# Research and Development

There are tons of opportunities for doing research with the data we
are collecting, our extension users and our APIs.

These people get to play around with our data and APIs to do amazing
research and build amazing things! These will then be used to promote
Mwmbl and grow the community.

We need researchers, social scientists, data scientists, hackers and
anyone that is excited about doing cool stuff with Mwmbl!
